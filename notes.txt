Controller
- minimize the use of require_once on classes. Autoload them instead. And then, better use of "use" keyword and namespaces
- BaseController should not contain a method of a specific external class
since it 
- Class Controllers (example Exporter) should contain minimal
number of lines since it is where the logic holds.
- remove HTML/CSS codes from classes.
